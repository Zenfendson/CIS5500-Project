# Project Outline
We plan to build a web application to visualize match data of the famous game League of Legends (LoL), mainly from professional Esport games from 2021 till now. The web application will show the game data of different players from different teams and different tournaments in multiple dimensions. It also provides the pick rate, ban rate, win rate and counters of different champion. Eventually, we hope we can build a machine learning model that predicts match wins based on both sides of the match for live Esport games.

## To run:
node version > 18.7.0
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## For all code used for cleaning, wrangling, and ingesting the data
